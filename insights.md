###### **Some insights from the data**
* The number of female sellers is greater than the male sellers.
* Sellers from 5 countries namely Armenia, Czech Republic, Hongrie, Malasie, Martnique have no sales.
    * All these are female sellers.
* Top 5 selling countries are as follows
      * France, Italie, Royaume-Uni, Espagne, Etats-Unis
* Top 5 countries with most number of products listed are as follows
      * Italie, France, Royaume-Uni, Etats-Unis, Espagne
* There seems to be a correlation -> this is confirmed by finding the ranks of countries based on total products sold and total number of prouducts listed.
###### **Some key times in the project**
* I was able to observe that the total number of products sold has also been included as row. That has been deleted.
* Created an index for a table that had no index by creating a new column and updating it with primary index of some other column
* I was able to find correlation between two columns based on the ranks of the rows with respect to columns. They were almost matching. There seems to be a positive correlation between them.
