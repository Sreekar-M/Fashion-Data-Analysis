###### **Some key aspects of the project**
* I was able to observe that the total number of products sold has also been included as row. That has been deleted.
* Created an index for a table that had no index by creating a new column and updating it with primary index of some other column
* Found correlation between two columns based on the ranks of the rows with respect to columns. They were almost matching. There seems to be a positive correlation between them.
